## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt alot on this project. I learnt how to use the min-height property in css. I also deployed on vercel for the first time.

### Continued development

I definitely want to focus on my use of CSS custom properties. I also want to work on writing better html markup. I'll also work on my use of version control.

### Useful resources

- [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHWT_V9pYu8) - This helped me better understand the overall project. I watched it when I hit a stumbling block in the project and it gave me insight and breakthrough in the project.
- [Blogpost](https://codingtorque.com/how-to-deploy-html-css-javascript-website-on-vercel/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand deployment using vercel. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
